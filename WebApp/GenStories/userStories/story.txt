I saw a small girl in the boat run toward him, with a little boy by her

hand, who looked to be about twelve or threescore years of age. He had a

large, dark complexion, and his brown eyes were very well

pigmented. He spoke very little, and said nothing to the

captain.



“Ah,” said the captain, “that’s what you’ll call a good boy.”



“What do you say?” asked the boy.



“I’ll take him along with the rest of the crew to find the treasure.”



The boy’s face brightened again and he ran toward the captain.



But as he passed the captain, he lost sight of him, and as he went on

running, the captain turned to look at the little girl. The girl

was playing with the little boy in the boat, and she was making

her way toward the treasure when she was suddenly carried away along the

water by the wind.



“What was that?” asked the captain.
